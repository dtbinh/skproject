%                                    UNSOLVED PROBLEMS in OSCOR-project
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%   1)Normally an intensity level of 99 or 999dB signifies that the SPL is was one of the independent variables.
%     For some OSCR-datasets that have an SPL of 99dB this is not the case. Were they actually recorded at 99dB.
%     These datasets are:
%     R95060    7-21-OSCR
%     R95110    23-4-OSCR
%     R96078    41-7-OSCR
%
%   2)The GWID-identifier of the master and slave DSS must be ABx/ABx for OSCRCTL-datasets, except for the following
%     datasets:
%     R95060    10-9-OSCRCTL
%     R96078    7-24-OSCRCTL
%     Was this wrongly supplied by the experimenter? The actually data doesn't look wrong!
