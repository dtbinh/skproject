%CalcRAPXXX   actual code for the calculation of RAP curves

%   Attention! This function is an internal function belonging to the RAP 
%   project and should not be invoked from the MATLAB command prompt.

%------------------------------implementation details-------------------------------
%   Following steps need to be taken for the implementation of a curve:
%
%   1)Checking of a dataset is already specified in the RAP session and if the 
%     particular curve can be calculated from the dataset ...
%   2)Applying calculation parameters ...
%   3)Calculating additional information if necessary ...
%   4)Assembling of a structure that contains all the data to generate an RAP plot, see
%     CreateRAPPlot.m for the layout of this structure. It can be passed entirely to this
%     function. The mandatoty text on a plot is the number of subsequences included
%     in the analysis in the upper left corner, the appliable calculation parameters in
%     the lower left corner (use AssembleRAPCalcParam.m) and if present calculated 
%     data extracted from the curve in the upper right corner ... 
%   5)Every calculation routine of the RAP project can change the RAP status variable,
%     this is neccessary because data retrieved from the calculations needs to be 
%     accessible afterwards, e.g. to replace substitution variables.
%
%   Attention! If the number of subsequences included in the analysis is more than one
%   and the curve can only be calculated for a single subsequence, an array of 
%   PlotStruct's needs to be returned ...
