%The USERDATA interface is accessed with the following functions:
%
%   1)When starting a new experiment, an experiment script has to be generated on the SGSR server. 
%     This is done via the command INITUSERDATA.
%   2)After a script was generated successfully, this script can be edited either by using the 
%     MATLAB-command EDITUSERDATA.
%   3)After the script file has been composed for an experiment, the information can be retrieved 
%     when analysing the recorded data. Use GETUSERDATA to retrieve userdata.
