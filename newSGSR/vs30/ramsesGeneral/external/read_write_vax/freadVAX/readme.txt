In R2009a, fopen no longer supports vaxd and vaxg file formats. This tool lets your use the ieee-le
file format to read these files in R2009a and later. These tools are not for writing vaxd or vaxg files.
Though you could write VAXF_to_uint32le.m, VAXD_to_uint64le.m, and VAXG_to_uint64le.m functions as well
as fwriteVAXD.m and fwriteVAXG.m files if you wanted to generate new files in VAXD or VAXG formats.

VAXD and VAXG are two methods VAX uses for representing floating point double precision numbers. VAX has
a single method for representing single precision floating point numbers, VAXF. A VAXD encoded file uses
VAXD standard for double precision and VAXF for single precision. A VAXG encoded file uses VAXG for
double precision and VAXF for single precision. Information for how numbers are encoded can be found

To patch your code:
    1) Open your file with the 'ieee-le' format instead of 'vaxd' or 'vaxg'.
    2) Replace fread commands with freadVAXD and freadVAXG functions.

Notes:
    1) freadVAXD and freadVAXG assume three input arguments whereas the fread in MATLAB can take a number
       of different input arguments.
    2) All code is written in MATLAB. Speed might be improved by writing C-MEX functions.

Example:

If your code originally looked like this:

fid = fopen('myfile', 'r', 'vaxd');
A = fread(fid, 2, 'double');
A = fread(fid, 3, 'uint32');
fclose(fid);

You would change your code to look like this: 


fid = fopen('myfile', 'r', 'ieee-le');
A = freadVAXD(fid, 2, 'double');
A = freadVAXD(fid, 3, 'uint32');
fclose(fid);
