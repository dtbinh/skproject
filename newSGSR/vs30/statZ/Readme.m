%
% Six new probability distributions.
% Of particular note are the noncentral versions of the chi-square,
% F, and t distributions. These are useful for finding the power of 
% a statistical test for various alternative hypotheses.
% 
% Parameter Estimation for Probability Distributions
% Parameter estimates and confidence intervals for eight distributions:
% beta, binomial, exponential, gamma, normal, Poisson, uniform and Weibull. 
% 
% Statistical Process Control 
% Control Charting functions
%     Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) plot.
%         Good for monitoring processes subject to mean drift.
%     S chart
%         Time-series plot of the standard deviation of samples.
%     X-bar plot
%         Time-series plot of the means of samples.
%     Capability plots
%         Determines the probability that a new observation will fall 
%         inside the specifications. Based on the assumption that the 
%         process is in control using a trial run of the process.
%     Histogram with fitted normal density.
%         Presentation graphic for showing process location.
% 
% Design of Experiments (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM).
% Factorial and D-optimal designs. Functions for generating designs,
