% FUNCTIONANALYSIS
%
% This folder contains functions that can be performed on a row vector of
% data. All functions should be of the following syntax:
%   O = functionName(XIn, YIn, {params}),
% with the structure O containing at least the following fields:
%   * O.XOut
%   * O.YOut
% This way functions in this directory can be generically used by other
% functions. When adding new functions to this directory, other functions
% shouldn't need to be adjusted.
