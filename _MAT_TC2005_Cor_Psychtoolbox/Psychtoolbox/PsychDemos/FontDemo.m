function FontDemo% FontDemo shows how to get the font you want, when you're not% sure what's available, and only certain fonts will do. This% is a portable solution to the problem of running on various% computers and Operating Systems that offer various fonts.%% In the FontDemo program we call CHAR to convert a one-string list,% e.g. {'Arial'}, to a string, e.g. 'Arial'. The Mac version of Screen% in fact does this automatically, and the Win version will too, but% that enhancement hasn't been implemented yet.% 5/23/02 dgp Wrote it.w=Screen(0,'OpenWindow');fprintf('New window opened with font set to %s.\n',Screen(w,'TextFont'));for font={'Arial','Geneva','Helvetica','sans-serif'}	Screen(w,'TextFont',char(font)); % Win: currently needs the call to CHAR.	match=strcmp(font,Screen(w,'TextFont'));	if match		break;	endendif ~match	error('Couldn''t find any of the fonts we wanted.');endfprintf('Successfully set font to %s.\n',Screen(w,'TextFont'));Screen(w,'Close');
