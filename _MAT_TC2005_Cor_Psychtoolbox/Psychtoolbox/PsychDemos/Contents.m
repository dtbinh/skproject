% Psychtoolbox:PsychDemos.%% help Psychtoolbox % For an overview, triple-click me & hit enter.%% These demos show how to use the Psychophysics Toolbox. Run a demo, see% what it does, and then look at the code: e.g. type "edit moviedemo" to% look at MovieDemo.m. SCREENDEMO is a good first choice. It demonstrates% much of the basic functionality. MOVIEDEMO is very simple, yet% demonstrates everything you need to show arbitrary images, one per% frame, at 75 Hz, or whatever rate your monitor runs at.  (And run% ScreenTest in PsychTests.)% % TIP: If you're going to run many of these demos, you may find it% convenient to copy the list into a new window. Double-click to select a% test; hit enter to run it.% % The "Use" column stars (*) particularly informative demos, and indicates% which platforms (Mac and Win) are supported.%%   Demo                      Use    Description%%   ActiveWireDemo             M W  Control PicoStar's USB ActiveWire i/o device.  %   BitPlaneDemo               M W  Use 8-bit frame buffer to hold 8 binary images.%   ClutMovieDemo              M W  Show a movie using lookup-table animation.%   ColorGratingDemo         * M W  Show a flickering full color grating.%   ContrastThreshDemo         M W  Measure contrast thresholds in noise.%   DialogDemo                 M    Use dialog box to get typed user response.%   DriftDemo                * M W  Display a drifting grating.%   ErrorCatchDemo             M W  Show how to code defensively against errors in M-file code.%   EpsDemo                    M W  Save an image (a grating in noise) to disk.%   FitGammaDemo               M W  Demonstrate gamma fitting routine FitGamma.%   FontDemo                   M W  Shows how to find the font you want.%   GammaFlipDemo              M    Flip screen gamma and clut.%   GetNumberDemo              M W  Get number or string from user.%   GratingDemo              * M W  Display a grating, at any pixelSize.%   IsomerizationsInDishDemo   M W  Compute photoreceptor isomerizations for retina in a dish.%   IsomerizationsInEyeDemo    M W  Compute photoreceptor isomerizations for human eye.%   JoystickDemo               M    Read any USB joystick.%   KbDemo                   * M W  Realtime keyboard monitoring, using KbCheck.%   LineDemo                   M W  Use antialiasing to draw a smooth line, no jaggies.%   MouseTraceDemo             M W  Track mouse around screen and draw contour.%   MovieDemo                * M W  Make a movie.%   MovieDemo2                 M W  Make a movie.
