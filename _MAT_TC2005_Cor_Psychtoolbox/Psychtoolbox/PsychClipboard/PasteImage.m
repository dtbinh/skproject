There no% longer seems to be any problem.% % PasteImage fails with some, but not all, images copied to the clipboard% from Adobe Photoshop. Copying the image from the clipboard into another% application (e.g. Microsoft Word) and then from that application to the% clipboard, usually works. (Guessing as to the cause, it's possible that% Photoshop is embedding the picture's ICC profile into the picture's% comment, making the picture odd in a way that PasteImage ought to but% doesn't cope with, and that Word is stripping the profile out. Embedding% the ICC profile is generally considered a good thing, enhancing the% reproducibility of the image, but, if this diagnosis is right,% PasteImage isn't coping with it.)
