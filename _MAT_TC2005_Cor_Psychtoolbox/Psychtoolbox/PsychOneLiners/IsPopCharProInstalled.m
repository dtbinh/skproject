function bool = IsPopCharProInstalled% IsPopCharProInstalled returns a quick answer to the yes/no question of% whether PopChar Pro is installed. PopChar Pro 1.3.3 is not compatible% with Matlab. See PopCharTest.% % We only look for "PopChar Pro", which is the currently available% commercial version. We don't look for the older "PopChar", which was% free, but no longer seems to be available. We haven't tested PopChar; it% may be ok. % web http://www.unisoft.co.at/products/popchar.html% % We use this test to warn the user about PopChar Pro,% and, if we detect it, suggest that it be removed.
