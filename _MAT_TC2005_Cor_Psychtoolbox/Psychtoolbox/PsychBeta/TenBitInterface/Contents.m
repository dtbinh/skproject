It was successful, but has been superceded by a more universal% solution provided by LoadClut. Please use LoadClut, which works with% all pixelSizes and any number of screens.%%   Adjust10BitClut         - Take a standard 10-bit clut and massage it for current hardware.%   CloseWindow             - Complement to OpenWindow.%   OpenWindow              - Open window.  Tries to be hardware independent.%   SetClut                 - Set the CLUT.  Tries to be hardware independent.%   SetColor                - Set a single color in the CLUT.
