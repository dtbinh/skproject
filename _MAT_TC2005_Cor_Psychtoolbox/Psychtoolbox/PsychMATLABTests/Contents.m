We've reported% all of them to Mathworks (the Case numbers are included), but% Mathworks won't be further developing Matlab for Mac OS 9, so no fixes% are expected. Note that Matlab 5.2.1 is the best-ever release of % Matlab for the Mac, and runs very well on Mac% OS 8 and 9. And we expect it to run well in the "Classic"% application environment of Mac OS X. In May, 2002, Mathworks announced% that they will release Matlab for Mac OS X by the end of the year.% web http://www.apple.com/macosx/% % ConcatenationBug       - Square and curly braces sometimes can't embrace multiple lines. 84454% fprintfBug             - FPRINTF may interpret the first argument as a filename. 201530% fprintfEmpty           - FPRINTF terminates when it gets an empty matrix []. 297266% fprintfLeak            - FPRINTF leaks memory (i.e. uses up the Temp memory heap). 319124% helpLinelength         - HELP terminates if a line exceeds 131 characters. 41758% iminfoBuglet           - IMINFO gives misleading error message. 187040% SpuriousDebuggerError  - The debugger works, but gives a spurious error message. 230201% StaleDirectoryCacheBug - Matlab's directory cache is not updated when you add files to /toolbox/. 230202% ylabelBug              - YLABEL command (in Matlab plots) bug and work around. 297565% Copyright (c) 2000 by David Brainard & Denis Pelli
