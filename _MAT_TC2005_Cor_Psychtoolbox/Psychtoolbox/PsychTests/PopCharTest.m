% PopCharTest demonstrates an init conflict caused by PopChar Pro 1.3.3% (latest version as of 2/25/02) with Matlab 5.2.1 under Mac OS 9.1. The% symptom is associated with Screen DrawText. When PopChar Pro is present,% requesting the optional second argument newY causes an internal Matlab% error "Attempt to free previously freed memory".% % I presume that PopCharPro intercepts the QuickDraw DrawText call and isn't% as innocuous as it's meant to be, resulting in damage to Matlab's memory% management code or data structure.% % This test fails with PopCharPro, but succeeds with the old, free PopChar 2.7.2, % which is no longer available, alas.% % CONCLUSION: Don't use PopChar Pro with Matlab.% % Thanks to Frans Cornelissen for help in tracking this down.% 2/24/02 dgp Wrote it.% 8/1/02  dgp Added result of testing with PopChar 2.7.2.window=Screen(0,'OpenWindow',[],[100 100 200 200]);% screen(window,'TextFont','Bookman');[newX,newY]=Screen(window,'DrawText','Hello world',10,100)Screen('CloseAll');
