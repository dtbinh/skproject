The programs in PsychDemos are intended to be% more tutorial in nature.% % The starred (*) tests are more ambitious, and systematically % characterize your computing environment, including the video cards,% computer, Psychtoolbox, Matlab, and OS. These analyses may help you% understand how to fully exploit your set up. The rest of the tests are% less interesting, simply exercising the function to show that it runs to% completion. Some of these are derived from the minimal programs users% submitted as part of a bug report, to document the fix.% % help psychdemos % For demos, triple-click me and hit enter.% % TIP: If you're going to run many of these tests, you may find it% convenient to copy the list into a new window.
