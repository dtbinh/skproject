function CursorTest% CursorTest% When this file is run as a function it works as expected. However, if% the same code is run as a script, by commenting out line 1, above, % then the cursor remains visible, as tj describes below.% % Thomas Jerde <thomasjerde@hotmail.com> reports difficulties in% controlling the visibility of the cursor, "GetMouse seems to call% ShowCursor. I want the cursor hidden, but every time i get the mouse% position (which is constantly in a tracking program), it reappears.% Backgrounding is off, so that's not responsible. So I call HideCursor% every time I call GetMouse. There doesn't seem to be any flicker, so% this is an acceptable solution. I also noticed that the hidden cursor% appears if I click on a menu, a scroll bar, or if the cursor passes over% the control strip at the bottom of the screen. Also, curiously, if I% call HideCursor many times, it appears I have to call ShowCursor% *almost* as many times to make it reappear. For example, if I call% HideCursor 100 times, the cursor reappears when I call ShowCursor% 80-some times. I'm confused. Of course, it's not really a problem (my% experiment runs fine), but I still find it curious."% % We believe that all of the strange symptoms are due to Thomas running% his program as a script, rather than as a FUNCTION. We can't do anything% about Matlab's interventions in script mode, but please report any% unexpected behavior that occurs when running as a FUNCTION.% psychtoolbox@yahoogroups.com% 7/1/02 dgp Wrote it.fprintf('CursorTest tests the hiding and showing of the cursor.
