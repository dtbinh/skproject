function TimingTest% TimingTest compares four timers for accuracy and ability to run % at high processor priority.% % We test four timers against each other. Typically% they are based on two independent timebases (UpTime and% Microseconds), which may run at slightly different rates. You may% run GetSecsTest.m to bring the two timebases into synch; TimingTest% will document its success. GetSecs and WaitSecs both use the same% timebase, usually UpTime. And GetTicks and CPUTIME use the Time% Manager's Microseconds. GetSecsTest.m scales UpTime's rate to agree% with that of Microseconds.% % GetSecs and WaitSecs use the VideoToolbox Seconds.c to access the% best available Mac timebase. Usually this is a counter in the% PowerPC chip, which is extremely reliable and accurate, accessed% through Apple's UpTime routine, which is available on nearly all% PowerPC Macs (the exceptions are old: 6100 and NuBus PowerMacs).% % Most time information on Macs (including time of day, Ticks,% Microseconds, and Matlab's CPUTIME) is derived from the Mac OS Time% Manager's Microseconds timebase, which is interrupt-driven. Macs can% occasionally miss interrupts, so the Time Manager's timebase% occasionally loses time. (When UpTime is not available, then% Seconds.c uses the Time Manager's Microseconds routine.)% % Matlab's CPUTIME is unreliable. 'help cputime' says that its internal % counter may occasionally overflow. Use GetSecs instead.% % TIMING ADVICE: the first time you access any MEX function or M file,% Matlab takes several hundred milliseconds to load it from disk.% Allocating a variable takes time too. Usually you'll want to omit% those delays from your timing measurements by making sure all the% functions you use are loaded and that all the variables you use are% allocated before you start timing. MEX files stay loaded until you% flush the MEX files (e.g. by changing directory or calling CLEAR% MEX). M files and variables stay in memory until you clear them.% % HISTORY: In Mac OS 9.0 GetSecs ran about 1% slow. % This was because the Apple-supplied conversion factor for% UpTime was slightly off. The Psychtoolbox provided GetSecsTest to allow% the user to apply a correction factor to get the time right. However, in% Mac OS 9.2.2 the problem is gone. We don't know which version of the OS% instituted the fix.% % See GetSecsTest to calibrate GetSecs.% 1/29/97  dhb  Added some comments.% 3/4/97   dhb  Added GetSecs examples too.% 3/15/97  dgp	Enhanced printout. Preload WaitSecs. % 3/16/97  dgp	Synch to ticks when timing ticks. Test Matlab's cputime.% 3/19/97  dhb  First WaitSecs call needed an argument, inserted.% 7/19/98  dgp  Removed all mention of obsolete TIMER.% 2/18/99  dgp  Enhanced to test improved accuracy of GetSecs.% 4/23/99  dgp  Say more about Mac OS Time Manager.% 6/18/02  dgp  Merged in the code from PriorityTest.fprintf('TimingTest\n');fprintf('\nASSESS ACCURACY OF CLOCKS, ONE AGAINST ANOTHER.\n\n');fprintf('WaitSecs and GetSecs are based on the VideoToolbox Seconds.c, which uses the \n');fprintf('UpTime timebase (a counter in your PowerPC chip), if available.
