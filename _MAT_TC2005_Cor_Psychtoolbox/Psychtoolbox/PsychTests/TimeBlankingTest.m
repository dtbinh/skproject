function TimeBlankingTest% TimeBlankingTest%% Test timing of the code that synchs to blanking. % All timing methods should give approximately the same answer.% % Each video frame ends with a blanking pulse, sent from your % computer to your monitor. All frame counting and % synchronization is done by reference to the beginning of that% blanking pulse.%% Thanks to David Ferster, whose documentation of problems% (now fixed) led to this demo.% 6/11/94	dhb	Wrote it.% 1/26/97	dgp	Minor editing, for more accurate timing.% 1/27/97   dhb	More minor editing, for yet more accurate timing.%           dhb	Deleted Pelli's description of TIMER bug, since it%           	  is now fixed. % 1/29/96   dhb	Denis realized we need to precall GetSecs to%              	account for its load time.  Added this. % 3/3/97    dhb	Cosmetic editing.               % 3/8/97    dgp	Updated.            % 3/9/97    dgp	Use Screen('Screens') to iterate over all screens. % 3/15/97   dgp	Ask user for permission to turn off filesharing.% 2/12/98   dgp	Name conflict. Change "version" to driverVersion.% 3/11/98   dgp	driverVersion was number, now string.% 8/12/98   dgp	added FrameRate.% 3/22/99   dgp	don't bother to turn off Filesharing or screensaver, since they don't seem%               to affect this program.% 4/24/02   awi Exit on PC with message.if strcmp('PCWIN',computer)    error('Win: TimeBlankingTest not yet supported.');end% Turn off things that might slow us down.% fsWasOn=FileShare(-3,1);% adWasOn=AfterDark(0);clear all;fprintf('TimeBlankingTest\n');DescribeComputerfor screenNumber=Screen('Screens')	% test every screen	% Describe video card	DescribeScreen(screenNumber);	DescribeScreenPrefs(screenNumber);		fprintf('%.1f Hz frame rate returned by FrameRate.\n',FrameRate(screenNumber));	% Preload all functions, to avoid delays later.	GetSecs;WaitSecs(0);		% 1.
