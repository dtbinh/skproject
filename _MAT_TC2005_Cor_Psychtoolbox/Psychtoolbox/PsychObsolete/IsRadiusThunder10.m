function is = IsRadiusThunder10(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)% is = IsRadiusThunder10(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)%% Reads card and driver names to determine whether the card is a Radius% graphics card with 10-bit DACs. IsRadiusThunder10 works for the Radius% ThunderColor cards in DHB's lab. The answer is cached so subsequent % calls are quick.% % IMPORTANT: Please try to avoid calling this routine directly. That would% make your software platform specific, which is something we are trying% to avoid. If you want to know your driver's DAC size (8, 9, or 10 bits)% or how to align the bits in the gamma table then call ScreenDacBits or% ScreenUsesHighGammaBits.% 8/20/00  dhb  Wrote it.% 9/9/00   dhb  Modified to use cache, check card too.% 3/20/02  dgp	Cosmetic.% 6/6/02   dgp	Renamed IsRadiusThunder10.% 6/20/02  dgp	Streamlined. Only compute for screens that the user asks about.% 6/29/02  dgp  Use new version of Screen VideoCard.global RadiusThunder10 % Cache answers for future reference.% Set up static information on first call.if isempty(RadiusThunder10)	RadiusThunder10 = NaN*Screen('Screens');ends=Screen(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'WindowScreenNumber')+1;if s<1	error('Passed windowPtrOrScreenNumber does not correspond to an installed screen.');endif isnan(RadiusThunder10(s))	card=Screen(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'VideoCard');	RadiusThunder10(s) = strcmp(card.driverName,'.Display_Marin') & strcmp(card.cardName,'RDUS,Marin');endis=RadiusThunder10(s);
