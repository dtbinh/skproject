%% Splitting Multichannel Sample-Based Signals into Several Multichannel Signals
%
% This example shows how to split a multichannel sample-based signal
% into other multichannel sample-based signals.
%
% The example comes directly from the DSP System Toolbox(TM) 
% User's Guide documentation section "Working with Signals -> Deconstructing Multichannel Sample-Based Signals"
