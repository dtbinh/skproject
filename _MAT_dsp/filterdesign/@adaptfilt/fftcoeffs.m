function fftcoeffs(this)
%FFTCOEFFS  FFT coefficients.
%   C = FFTCOEFFS(Hd) returns the frequency-domain coefficients used when
%   filtering. 
% 
%   NOTE: FFTCOEFFS is available for the following adaptive filters:
%       ADAPTFILT.FDAF
%       ADAPTFILT.UFDAF
%       ADAPTFILT.PBFDAF
%       ADAPTFILT.PBUFDAF
